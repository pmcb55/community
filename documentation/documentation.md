If you want to build on Solid, or get a better understanding for what's under the hood in Solid, you've come to the right place. 

These materials will continue to be a work in progress as Solid grows and expands, so please [submit an issue](https://github.com/solid/information/issues) if you can’t find what you’re looking for, or [submit a pull request](https://github.com/solid/information/pulls) if you have suggestions for improvements. 

Building on Solid is easier when you have an understanding of the [Solid terms](https://github.com/solid/information/blob/master/documentation/solid-dictionary.md), the [fundamentals of the Solid Specification](https://github.com/solid/information/blob/master/documentation/solid-specification.md), as well as the [basics of Linked Data](https://github.com/solid/information/blob/master/documentation/learning-linked-data.md). The entire data model is built around Linked Data, and it drives the most powerful aspects of Solid.

# Building Apps 

Get your first decentralised  app working in the time it takes to find and finish a box of spring rolls. You’ll still want to come back and learn the fundamentals, but you’ll be surprised how quickly you can get something up and working without them.

# Building Pods 

Pods are personal online data stores. One can either use a Pod provider who offers data storage as a service, or self-host a Pod.

Learn how to [become a Pod provider](https://github.com/solid/information/blob/master/documentation/pods.md#installing-and-running-node-solid-server) or [self-host](https://github.com/solid/information/blob/master/documentation/pods.md#self-hosting-pods). 

You may also find the [Solid developer tools](https://github.com/solid/information/blob/master/documentation/developer-tools.md) helpful.

Pods may or may not be linked to identification.
